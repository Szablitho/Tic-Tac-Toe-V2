### Description
It's restructured in files and code, bug-free and future-update ready version of popular gamer Tic-Tac-Toe coded by myself this time with help of instructor on udemy. I did use additional or alternative methods like ternary operator where it was possible or set event listener on different way. I've learnt handful of good practises in programing.

Check out older version too if you are curious how bad was it compairing to second version.
